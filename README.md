-----
Note: I know I could use different libraries to simplify the process a lot, but I prefer writing everything by myself for different reasons:

- Learning purpose.
- Write code the way I want without having to adapt my project for a specific library.
- Performance and optimization of the software **mainly** depends on my code.
- A lot more...
